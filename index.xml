      <description>I am officially 25% through my challenge! I&amp;rsquo;m not necessarily completing the challenge as fast as planned, but it is still really good to spend some dedicated time working on things.
During these last couple of days, I have spent my time learning how to implement Transformers using Hugging Face. I also was able to complete a rough proof-of-concept for my senior project! This weeks goals include building out the web scraper and decided how to distribute the results!</description>

      <description>Things got a little crazy there at the beginning of August. Between the beginning of school and other things I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to put the time into this that I have wanted to. Over the past 9 days I have been starting to think of ideas for a senior project. Through these ideas I have began to look into learning how to use PyTorch instead of Tensorflow. The next steps for my 100 days will be learning how to use PyTorch specifically with BERT and GPT-2.</description>

      <description>For this section of my 100 days challenge I focused on some NLP of disaster tweets. I worked on the NLP Disaster Tweets competition on Kaggle. My Kaggle Notebook. While working on this I started with this Starter Notebook. Something I learned was how to use GloVe for text vectorization. Many of the changes I did on the starter notebook were reducing some of the cleanup since they didn&amp;rsquo;t affect the models performance.</description>

      <description>I have decided to spend an hour a day for the next 100 days sharpening my skills specifically in the data science and machine learning fields.
For day 1 I decided to read some articles to begin brainstorming ideas for projects for these 200 days. The three articles I read with some key takeaways:
 Open-endedness: The last grand challenge youâ€™ve never heard of  Many current evolutionary algorithms only run for a short time and converge to a solution.</description>

      <title>Book Recommendation using KNN</title>

      <description>The purpose of this project was to experiment building a recommendation enginer with a kth-Nearest-Neighbor approach. This can be used in a variety of applications other than a book recommendation such as movie recommendation, music recommendation, shopping recommendation, etc.
The distribution of book ratings can be seen in the below figure.   Based off that distribution I dropped all the records that had less than 250 ratings. After doing this the post-filter amount of ratings per record can be displayed like this:   When building the model I decieded on using a cosine metric and left the algorithim as auto.</description>

      <title>Dog VS Cat</title>

      <description>The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with Tensorflow for image classification. Also switched from running the python from a python file to a jupyter notebook.
The figure below shows the distribution of images with 1 being cat and 0 being dog.
    The accuracy after running the model for 30 epochs was around 82%
  When running this model on a final generated test set 8 out of 10 of the returned values was correct which is expected given the accuracy.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this project is to learn about both abstractive and extractive text summarization using NLP and deep learning.
Extractive  This algorithim can be found in extractive.py. This algorithim works by ranking sentences based off importance and then compiles the top 50% of them.
Abstractive  Attempted to make an abstractive model to summarize the text. Ran into an issue encoding the text for the model.</description>

      <description>Used a dataset found on Kaggle that had a personality type and social media posts Using tensorflow and keras created a model to predict a personality given the social media posts. The current highest accuracy is around 20%, so there is definite room for improvement.  Link to Github Repository</description>

      <description> This project is still a work in progress I have created the game of snake using Python and the pygame library I begin implementing the A* algorithm to find the shortest path to the next snack after each snack is eaten I plan to begin working on a neural network to learn to play the game automatically   Link to Github Repository  </description>
